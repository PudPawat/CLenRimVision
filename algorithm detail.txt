1 : average (1-lower bound) < area_detect < average(1+upper bound)
average calculate by average in range of sd 

2 : average (1-lower bound) < area_detect < average(1+upper bound)
average calculate by area - lower bound box +  upper bound box 
average will the be the same in each region 

3 : average (1-lower bound) < area_detect < average(1+upper bound)
average calculate by area - lower bound box +  upper bound box 
average will the be the same in each region also average calculate by average in range of sd 

4 : average (1-lower bound) < X < average(1+upper bound)
average (1-lower bound) < Y < average(1+upper bound)
USING : bounding box of contour NOT area as first algorithm
